## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a self taught **python/django developer** currently working at Varicocele Healing Ltd, built and maintaining a Minimum Viable SAAS platform. I like learning and experimenting with new technologies as they come. I am an open-source enthusiast and a always on the hunt for tools and ideas that make me more productive. I occasionally write on my blog about new technologies, coding, how-tos, etc.

Passionate about creating custom software or tools to fullfill a customer or client's requirements. Would love to work with a large team of like minded people working towards a single goal. I enjoy moving towards finding a solution and systematically solving the many problems that arise as I move towards it. Check out my git repos feel free to leave any issues or comments and feel free to contact me through linkedin or medium.
