## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer currently working at Varicocele Healing Ltd, built and maintaining a Minimum Viable SAAS platform. I like learning and experimenting with new technologies as they come. I try to build things that will save me from manual work. I am an open-source enthusiast and a dark mode everything person. I occasionally write on my blog about new technologies, coding, how-tos, travel etc.
